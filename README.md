PTTP
====

PTTP (Python Text Transfer Protocol) is a Python 3 HTTP request tester. It is designed to make use and development of HTTP APIs as easy as possible.

PTTP is designed for GNU/Linux but it will work with any operating system that has Zenity and Python 3 installed (and added to its path). With a bit of work I have managed to run this on Mac OS X 10.8 and FreeBSD.

###Features
* GET requests
* GET requests with basic authentication
* POST requests
* POST requests with basic authentication
* Graphical interface
* HTML and plain text displays

###Dependencies
* Python 3
* Zenity (you should already have this installed as part of your desktop environment)

###Running PTTP

####Release version
After installing it by running the "install.sh" file (if nothing happens after running it you may need to open it in the terminal). Just open the terminal and type in "pttp" (without the quotes).

####Development version
Go into the directory you downloaded PTTP to and run the file called "PTTP".
